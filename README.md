I lieu of public repositories, I'd like to outline some of my work and leave an avenue to contact me. All of my work is currently rolled out with R and it's extensions. <br>
With R I can access, tidy, graph, carry out statistical analysis, and utilise machine learning algorithms on all forms of data. <br>
Of most interest would be interactive dashboards coded with R Shiny (an app building extension). They are excellent for presenting: 
<ul><li>Graphs that react to a users input</li>
  <li>Aesthetic, easily navigable tables</li>
  <li>Coded backend which delivers a range of computed output including statistical analysis and machine learning</li></ul>
A more easily shared optiion would be HTML reports, rendered in R markdown:
<ul><li>Produces a HTML file that can be accessed by anyone or printed</li>
  <li>Can be attached with the code used giving absolute visibility and data integrity</li>
  <li>Easy to follow statistical analysis and machine learning through a document format</li></ul>
<br>
I can provide examples of the above, devoid of sensitive data, on request.<br>
