I lieu of public repositories, I'd like to outline some of my work and leave an avenue to contact me. All of my work is currently rolled out with R and it's extensions. <br>
Of most interest would be interactive dashboards coded with R Shiny (an app building extension). They are excellent for presenting: 
<ul><li>Graphs that react to a users input</li>
  <li>Aesthetic, easily navigable tables</li>
  <li>Coded backend which delivers a range of computed output</li>
